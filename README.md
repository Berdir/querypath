# QueryPath: Find the better way

QueryPath is a jQuery-like library for working with XML and HTML(5) documents in PHP. It is stable software, [with the original library garnering 4M+ downloads](https://packagist.org/packages/querypath/querypath) since first published in 2009.

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is a fork of a fork. The [original library](https://github.com/technosophos/querypath), and [subsequent fork](https://github.com/arthurkushman/querypath), are no longer being maintained. The aim of `gravitypdf/querypath` is to ensure the library remains compatible with the latest version of PHP, and bug free. üßë‚ÄçüíªThere is still a lot of legacy code to clean up + modernize, and any assistance given is appreciated.**

## Installation
``` 
composer require gravitypdf/querypath 
```

## Basic Usage

You can parse documents like this:

```php
<?php
// Assuming you installed from Composer:
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// HTML5
$qp = html5qp('path/to/file.html');

// Legacy HTML via libxml
$qp = htmlqp('path/to/file.html');

// XML or XHTML
$qp = qp('path/to/file.html');

// All of the above can take string markup instead of a file name:
$qp = qp('<?xml version='1.0'?><hello><world/></hello>')
```

The real power of QueryPath comes from chaining methods together:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

html5qp(\QueryPath\QueryPath::HTML5_STUB, 'title')
  // Add some text to the title
  ->text('Example of QueryPath.')
  // Now look for the <body> element
  ->top('body')
  // Inside the body, add a title and paragraph.
  ->append('<h1>This is a test page</h1><p>Test text</p>')
  // Now we select the paragraph we just created inside the body
  ->children('p')
  // Add a 'class="some-class"' attribute to the paragraph
  ->attr('class', 'some-class')
  // And add a style attribute, too, setting the background color.
  ->css('background-color', '#eee')
  // Now go back to the paragraph again
  ->parent()
  // Before the paragraph and the title, add an empty table.
  ->prepend('<table id="my-table"></table>')
  // Now let's go to the table...
  ->top('#my-table')
  // Add a couple of empty rows
  ->append('<tr></tr><tr></tr>')
  // select the rows (both at once)
  ->children()
  // Add a CSS class to both rows
  ->addClass('table-row')
  // Now just get the first row (at position 0)
  ->eq(0)
  // Add a table header in the first row
  ->append('<th>This is the header</th>')
  // Now go to the next row
  ->next()
  // Add some data to this row
  ->append('<td>This is the data</td>')
  // Write it all out as HTML
  ->writeHTML5();
```

You can also search for specific elements and loop over any matches:

```php
$html = '
<ul>
    <li>Foo</li>
    <li>Bar</li>
    <li>FooBar</li>
</ul>';

$qp = html5qp($html);
foreach ($qp->find('li') as $li) {
    echo $li->text() .'<br>';
}
```
